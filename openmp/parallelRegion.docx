#pragma omp parallel private(tid)

The clause private(tid) in #pragma omp parallel means that each thread in the parallel region gets its own private copy of the variable tid. 
Changes made to tid by one thread do not affect the value of tid in other threads. This is important for thread safety, ensuring that each thread 
can store its own thread ID without interfering with others.

tid = omp_get_thread_num();

The function omp_get_thread_num() is an OpenMP library function that returns the unique thread ID of the calling thread within the current parallel region. 
The ID is an integer starting from 0 (for the master thread) up to N-1, where N is the total number of threads. This allows each thread to identify itself 
and perform thread-specific operations.

In your code, the number of threads in the parallel region is determined by OpenMP’s default settings or by user configuration. By default, OpenMP uses the number
of available CPU cores. However, you can control the number of threads by:

Setting the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable before running the program.
Using the num_threads clause in the pragma, e.g., #pragma omp parallel num_threads(4).
If neither is set, OpenMP chooses a reasonable default (usually the number of processor cores). In your code, since neither is specified, 
the number of threads is set automatically by OpenMP.

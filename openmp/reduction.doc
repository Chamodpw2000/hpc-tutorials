* DESCRIPTION:
*   OpenMP Example - Combined Parallel Loop Reduction - C/C++ Version
*   This example demonstrates a sum reduction within a combined parallel loop
*   construct.  Notice that default data element scoping is assumed - there
*   are no clauses specifying shared or private variables.  OpenMP will 
*   automatically make loop index variables private within team threads, and
*   global variables shared.

This is an OpenMP example demonstrating reduction—a technique for safely accumulating results from parallel computations.

What the Code Does:

Creates arrays a and b initialized with values (0, 1, 2, ..., 99)
Computes the dot product: sum = a[0]*b[0] + a[1]*b[1] + ... + a[99]*b[99]
Uses parallel threads to speed up the computation
The Problem Without Reduction:
Without proper handling, if multiple threads try to update sum simultaneously:


sum = sum + (a[i] * b[i]);

You'd have a race condition—threads overwrite each other's results, and you lose data.

The Solution: reduction(+:sum)

#pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum)

This clause:

Creates a private copy of sum for each thread — each thread gets its own temporary sum
Each thread accumulates results into its private copy (no conflicts)
Combines all private sums using the + operator at the end (final result)

Example with 4 threads:

Thread 0 computes: sum_0 = a[0]*b[0] + a[1]*b[1] + ... (its share)
Thread 1 computes: sum_1 = a[25]*b[25] + ... (its share)
Thread 2 computes: sum_2 = ... (its share)
Thread 3 computes: sum_3 = ... (its share)
Final: sum = sum_0 + sum_1 + sum_2 + sum_3
Common Reduction Operators: +, -, *, & (bitwise AND), | (bitwise OR), ^ (XOR), && (logical AND), || (logical OR), min, max

This is a safe and efficient way to aggregate results from parallel computations.
